!! 1. Introduction
This page summarizes the different types of knowledge formalization that are provided by KnowWE. \\
To organize... TODO
In KnowWE, knowledge-bases for diagnostic problem-solving can be created ad-hoc in the wiki. 

!! 2. Defining a Knowledge Base

A new knowledge base is defined by the {{{knowledgebase}}}Â markup. The following example defines a new knowledge base with the name "Car faults diagnosis" having the specified comment. 
All knowledge slices with the package "default" are included in the knowledge base.

%%prettify 
{{{
%%knowledgebase 
Car faults diagnosis
@ID: CAR_FAULTS_DEMO_ID
@Author: joba
@Comment: Example car fault diagnosis knowledge base.
@compile: default
/%}}}
/%

Please note, that any knowledge markup ends in the "default" package, until it is defined otherwise.  



! A. Terminology knowledge
* __Questions__ - see __[Doc Questions|Doc Questions]__. General inclusion: 
{{{
%%Question ...
}}}

* __Solutions__ - see __[Doc Solutions|Doc Solutions]__. General inclusion: 
{{{
%%Solution... 
}}}

* __Object Attributes__: see __[Doc Attribute Tables|Doc AttributeTables]__. General inclusion:
{{{
<AttributeTable-section> ... </AttributeTable-section>
}}}


! B. Derivation knowledge
* __Decision Trees__ - see __[Doc Questions|Doc Questions]__ (section D., about derivation mechanisms). General inclusion:
{{{
%%Question ...
}}}
* __Rules__ - see __[Doc Rules|Doc Rules]__. General inclusion:
{{{
%%Rule ...
}}}
* __Set-covering knowledge__ - see __[Doc Set-Covering Knowledge|Doc SetCoveringKnowledge]__. General inclusion:
{{{
%%CoveringList ... 
}}}


!! Useful Advice
!A. Copy and Paste
We strongly recommend to make extensive use of copy & paste to avoid typos that could lead to misinterpretation or malfunctions. On the Doc-pages we provide many examples for all kinds of knowledge formalizing patterns---those can and should be used as a starting point. So feel free to copy & paste them to avoid typos regarding the basic syntax and keywords. \\
Once you have begun to define some knowledge---say, for example, a question hierarchy---you should use copy & paste to insert question names wherever you need them (e.g., in rules...). That way you can ensure an identical naming.\\

''An exact accordance of the names throughout all knowledge definitions is a required condition for a correct problem-solving behavior. ''
