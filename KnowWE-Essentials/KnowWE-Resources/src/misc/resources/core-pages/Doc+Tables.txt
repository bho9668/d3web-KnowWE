[{TableOfContents title='Table Editing in KnowWE'}] 

!! 1. Definition 
KnowWE provides 2 ways of creating and editing tables: manually, syntactically similar to table editing in other wikis, and ''quick editing'', which provides a more visual way to edit a table. 

!! 2. Syntax: Standard Tables 
Tables structures in KnowWE are marked up by vertical slashes. Each cell is marked up by one preceeding vertical slash. It is possible to create table headings by using a double vertical slash for defining each heading cell. The table syntax is best understood by looking at a small example: 
{{{ 
||Heading 1 || Heading 2 || Heading 3 
|Content 1-1| Content 1-2| Content 1-3 
|Content 2-1| Content 2-2| Content 2-3 
}}} 

renders to: 

||Heading 1 || Heading 2 || Heading 3 
|Content 1-1| Content 1-2| Content 1-3 
|Content 2-1| Content 2-2| Content 2-3 

As the example shows, heading cells are introduced by a double vertical slash each, normal content cells are marked by a single slash. 

!! 3. Syntax ''Quick Editing'' Tables 
! A. Basic Definition
To create tables that provide the ''quick editing'' functionality, the table definition has to be enclosed in ''TABLE'' tags, as in the following example: 
{{{<Table> 
||Heading 1 || Heading 2 || Heading 3 
|Content 1-1| Content 1-2| Content 1-3 
|Content 2-1| Content 2-2| Content 2-3 
</Table>}}} 

which is rendered as: 
<Table> 
||Heading 1 || Heading 2 || Heading 3 
|Content 1-1| Content 1-2| Content 1-3 
|Content 2-1| Content 2-2| Content 2-3 
</Table> 
As the above example shows, this table differs slightly from the standard table. On the one hand, it is rendered using another color scheme, on the other hand a small pencil-shaped button is added to the upper left corner above the table. 
\\ 
Clicking on the pencil-symbol opens the quick-editing view of the table, which is shown in the next screenshot:

[{Image src='Bild 1.png' width='100%' height='..' align='left|center|right' style='..' class='..' }]

Now the cells of the table are directly editable. Please note, that changes/modifications are NOT saved if the pencil-symbol is clicked again. This just brings up the non-editable rendering of the table again. If changes are to be saved, the __''save''__ butto has to be clicked. After clicking on ''__save__'', the non-editable view of the table is presented again, displaying now the modifications.

! B. Additional Attributes
The starting ''Table'' tag can be provided with optional attributes. Note, however, that none of the attributes is required to enable the edit mode!

\\
__default__
\\

This enables the definition of default values for the cells. The value of this attribute is a comma separated list of values. Those values are then displayed as a drop down field that is displayed for each cell instead of an HTML input field. Note, that this in turn means, that only the provided values can be chosen for modifying such a table and no user-defined input is possible.
{{{<Table default="P1,P2,P3">
|row1 - cell 1 |row1 - cell2 |row1 - cell3
|row2 - cell 1 |row2 - cell2 |row2 - cell3
</Table>}}}
The following screenshot shows the rendering of the example table with default values:
[{Image src='Bild 2.png' width='100%' height='..' align='left|center|right' style='..' class='..' }]

\\
__width__
\\

The ''width'' attribute defines the width of each cell in quick edit mode. The value consists of a floating-point number, followed by an absolute units designator (cm, mm, in, pt, ..) or a relative units designator (em, ex, or px). If none units designator is provided, the number will be interpreted as ''px''.
\\
The following table definition, for example, creates a table with quite large input fields:
{{{<Table width="250">
|row1 - cell 1 |row1 - cell2 |row1 - cell3
|row2 - cell 1 |row2 - cell2 |row2 - cell3
</Table>}}}

In quick edit mode this is rendered as:
[{Image src='Bild 3.png' width='100%' height='..' align='left|center|right' style='..' class='..' }]
\\
This also works, if default values are provided and input fields are thus rendered as drop-down lists, as the following example shows:

{{{<Table default="P1,P2,P3" width="70">
|row1 - cell 1 |row1 - cell2 |row1 - cell3
|row2 - cell 1 |row2 - cell2 |row2 - cell3
</Table>}}}

Which is in quick edit mode rendered as:
[{Image src='Bild 4.png' width='100%' height='..' align='left|center|right' style='..' class='..' }]
