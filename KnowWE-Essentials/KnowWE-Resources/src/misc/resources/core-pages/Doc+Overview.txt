__KnowWE__ is a Semantic Wiki based on the open-source wiki engine JSPWiki, enhanced by core libraries of d3web and semantic extensions of the KnowWE project. We call KnowWE a ''__Semantic Knowledge Wiki__'' since it emphasizes the development/formalization and usage of explicit problem-solving knowledge.
