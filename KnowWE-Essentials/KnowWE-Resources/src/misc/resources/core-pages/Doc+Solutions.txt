!!Definition 
The solutions (diagnoses), the knowledge base has to recognize, are defined by the {{{%%Solution ...}}} tag. For a larger number of solutions, it is advisable to describe a hierarchic structure. The number of hyphens at the beginning of each line corresponds with the hierarchic depth of the following solution. 

!!Syntax 
{{{%%Solution
Mechanical Problem 
- Damaged idle speed system 
- Leaking air intake system ~ "The air intake system is leaking." 
- Clogged air filter ~ "The air filter is clogged and probably just needs some cleaning." 
- Bad ignition timing 
Electronics Problem 
- Flat battery 
- Defect ABS 
Other Problem ~"Sorry, the problem could not be identified." 
%}}} 

* The example shows three superior solutions (''Mechanical Problem'', ''Electronics Problem'' and ''Other Problem''). The first two of them are further divided hierarchically into more specific diagnoses ''(Damaged idle speed system'', ''Leaking air intake system'', ...), which are therefore indented by one hyphen. Superior solutions, as e.g. ''Mechanical Problem'' are often also called problem area. 
* It is also possible to enter a more descriptive solution text. This is achieved by adding a tilde, followed by the more detailed text, to the solution name. Then the shorter solution name is used for internal representation of the solution (e.g., within rules) and the descriptive text is shown to the user in the dialog. As shown below, for example, ''Other Problem'' is the solution name, whereas ''Sorry, the problem could not be identified.'' is the more descriptive text.
