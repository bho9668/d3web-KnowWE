[{TableOfContents title='Rules - TOC'}] 

!!1. Definition 
Rules can be defined as one means for creating derivation knowledge. Thereby, a basic syntax exists that can be slightly varied to create different types of rules. Those types substantially vary in their distinct rule actions and are explained after the presentation of the basic syntax. 

!!2. Syntax - Basics 
Rules are defined within a ''%%Rule ... %'' tag in KnowWE. The basic syntax is as follows (rc = rule condition): 
{{{%%Rule
IF (rc) 
THEN (rule action) 
%}}} 
Furthermore it is possible to add an exception condition to the rule, like in the following example (__IMPORTANT: EXCEPT is currently not supported! Added as a known issue.__): 
{{{
IF (rc) 
EXCEPT (rc2) 
THEN (rule action) 
}}} 

The following operators can be used to build more complex expressions from simple rule conditions: 
* __NOT__( rc ) --- true, if rc does not apply 
* (rc) __AND__ (rc2) --- true, only if both rc and rc2 apply at the same time 
* (rc1) __OR__ (rc2) --- true, if at least one of rc and rc2 does apply 
\\ 


!!3. Different rule types 
As previously mentioned, the different rule types vary in their rule actions, that is, the part of the rule following the ''THEN'' keyword. In the following the rule types available in KnowWE are listed and shortly explained. For a more detailed explanation and syntax examples please refer to the separate pages for each rule type. 

!A. Scoring Rules 
Scoring rules (diagnosis rules) are used to assign specific score points to a solution. See the page about __[scoring rules. | Doc DiagnosisRule]__ for the syntax and an overview of the possible score points. 

!B. Abstraction Rules 
It is possible to assign values to a question via abstraction rules. That way, the program sets certain answer values depending on those answer values provided by the user for previous questions. See the page about __[abstraction rules | Doc AbstractionRule]__ for the syntax and further detail. 

!C. Indication Rules 
Indication rules basically initiate the presentation of certain, subsequent questions or questionnaires to the user depending on previously provided answers. For syntax and further detail see the page about __[indication rules | Doc IndicationRule]__.
