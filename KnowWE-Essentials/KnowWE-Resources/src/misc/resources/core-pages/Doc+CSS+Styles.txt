[{TableOfContents title='CSS Styles - TOC'}]

!! 1. Definition
In KnowWE, style-definitions for arbitrary text sections of a page can be defined via the ''CSS tag''. That way, each part of every article in the wiki can be styled individually. The defined style is applied when the page is rendered.

!! 2. Syntax
To style a piece of text or a section of an article, it simply has to be surrounded by an opening and closing ''CSS tag'': 
{{{The word <CSS style="color:red"> XCL </CSS> is highlighted with a red color.}}}
The above example shows, how to highlight the word ''XCL'' through coloring it red. This renders to:
\\
The word <CSS style="color:red"> XCL </CSS> is highlighted with a red color.

\\
Another example: <CSS style="color:blue; font-style:italic; font-size:1.25em">some bigger blue text with an italic font style</CSS>\\
is created by
{{{<CSS style="color:blue; font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em">some bigger blue text with an italic font style</CSS>}}}

\\
As the examples show, the text that is to be styled is surrounded by an opening and closing ''CSS tag''. The opening tag has an attribute ''style''; here the style information has to be provided that KnowWE later uses for rendering the styled text. Generally, as style information everything can be inserted that is permitted by ''Cascading Style Sheets''. \\
For those not familiar with Cascading Style Sheets we suggest, for example, the following [CSS tutorial | http://de.selfhtml.org/css/index.htm].
