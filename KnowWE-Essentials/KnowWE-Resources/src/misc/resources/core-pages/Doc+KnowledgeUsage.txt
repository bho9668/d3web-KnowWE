!!Overview
Currently, KnowWE provides different features that enable knowledge usage for problem-solving in KnowWE: inline questions and quick interview. 

!!Syntax and Examples

!Inline Questioning 

Inline questions are questions that are directly embedded into the text; relevant phrases are annotated, and an appropriate question is rendered when the user clicks on those phrases. An actual example could look like this:
{{{ {{ask about exhaust fumes <=> asks:: Exhaust fumes}} }}} 
which renders to: {{ask about exhaust fumes  <=> asks:: Exhaust fumes}} 
The syntax and the possible types of inline knowledge annotation are described in more detail on the page [Doc InlineKnowledgeAnnotation| Doc InlineKnowledgeAnnotation].

__Note: Does not work properly for pre-"Ms Moneypenny" tests!__
 



! QuickInterview 
A simple listing of questions that can be answered by clicking on them. The quick interview is generated by inserting the following tag into the wiki page: 

{{{[{KnowWEPlugin quickInterview}]}}}

! Solutions Pane

The solution pane displays all derived solutions and abstractions. The pane can been configured, so that only specific classes of derivations are displayed. 

%%prettify 
{{{
%%ShowSolutions
@master: <article name>
@show_established: <true/false>
@show_suggested: <true/false>
@show_excluded: <true/false>
@show_abstractions: <true/false>
%
}}}
/%

The annotation {{{@master}}} is required and specifies the name of the wiki article, where the master is defined, i.e., where the {{{%%knowledgebase}}} tag is used to compile the knowledge base. 
Consequently, all solutions and abstractions are displayed, that are derived by this knowledge base.
