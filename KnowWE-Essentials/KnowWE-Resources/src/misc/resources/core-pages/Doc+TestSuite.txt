[{TableOfContents title='Test Suites HowTo - TOC' numbered='false'}}]

!! 1. Definition
A test suite consists of several (but at least one) sequential test cases. Within a sequential test case several (but again at least one) rated test cases are defined. A rated test case specifies the expected solution state if certain answers are provided for certain questions. Extending a sequential test case iteratively through additional rated test cases permits to observe how the solutions' states change if further questions are answered or if previous answers are modified.\\

Test suites mainly aim at verifying that derived solutions' states match the expected solutions' states defined in the rated test cases. Solutions are automatically derived when a test suite is run (see: 'how to run a test suite' below). 

!! 2. Syntax 
A wiki article in KnowWE can only contain one test suite---the ''Testsuite-section''---at a time. Inside this Testsuite-section any number of sequential test cases can be defined, and within those in turn the rated test cases. \\

A ''__sequential test case__'' is first given a user-defined name. This name is followed by opening and closing curly braces, containing the rated test cases. \\

In a ''__rated test case__'' first all the findings (in the form ''question = answer'') are listed, separated by commas; the last finding, however,  is followed by a colon. After that colon all expected solutions (followed by their expected state in braces) are listed, separated by commas. Following the last solution is a semicolon.


{{{%%Testsuite
Leaking air intake system {

    Driving = insufficient power on partial load :
    Leaking air intake system (suggested);
    
    Driving = unsteady idle speed :
    Clogged air filter (suggested),
    Leaking air intake system (suggested);
    
    Air filter o.k.? = yes,
    Driving = insufficient power on full load :
    Leaking air intake system (established);
}

Clogged air filter {
    
    Exhaust pipe color = sooty black,
    Fuel = unleaded gasoline :
    Clogged air filter (suggested);
    
    Driving = unsteady idle speed,
    Driving = weak acceleration,       
    "Ignition timing o.k.?" = yes :
    Clogged air filter (established);

}

The presented example contains two sequential test cases. The first one defines that the solution ''leaking air intake system'' should receive the state ''established'' if ''Air filter o.k.?'' is answered with ''yes'' and ''Driving'' with ''insufficient power on full load''. The second rated test case constitutes an example for the solution ''clogged air filter''.\\

Additionally it is necessary to specify against which knowledge base you want to test. Therefor you need the ''@KnowledgeBase'' annotation. The argument for this annotation is the name of a wiki article containing a compiled knowledge base.

Please note that these examples are kept rather small to demonstrate the main functionality and the syntax. Test cases that are actually applied can or should be much bigger.


!! 3. How to run a test suite
A test suite is run by using the test suite result type. This type allows you to specify which test suite (article) you want to run. The test suite result type can be used in the following way.

{{{
%%TestSuiteRunner
This is custom text
@TestSuite Demo - Test Cases
/%
}}}

The annotation ''TestSuite'' specifies the article / test suite which will be tested. Additionally it is possible to add some text to this type. This text will be rendered in the top-left corner of the type.
