!! Resources

Additional resources can be added to a knowledge base either as text or a binary file (e.g. multimedia file).

The markup allows to specify a path name. The file content will be stored inside the knowledge bases resources under that specified path name. If no path name is used, the attachment name is used for the filename and the article name as the parent folder.

The following example stores the text "Hello, I am a resource!" in the downloaded d3web knowledge base under the file {{{multimedia/resource.txt}}}.

{{{
%%Resource
Hello, I am a resource!
@path: Resource.txt
%
}}}
