!!! KnowWE2 Example Page

This page demonstrate how to use KnowWE2 by showing a simple example.
Knowledge about the Problem "What to do this evening" is put together using the XCL formalization pattern. Then the possibilities for executing and reviewing the knowledge are shown.

!! Defining explicit knowledge

Starting a Knowledge Base using the Kopic tag:
* At first the questions are defined
* Then we additionally can enter some covering knowledge for solutions
* For clarity the lists for the solutions are very short in this demo. On real knowledge definition for expressive results at least 8 relations per list are recommended, the more the better.

!! Use of Knowledge

! Questionsheet
With the tag 
%%prettify 
{{{
[{KnowWEPlugin questionsheet}]

}}}
/%
a list of questions is generated. Those can be answered by clicking on them, as shown here:




[{KnowWEPlugin questionsheet}]

! Embedded Dialog
With the tag 
%%prettify 
{{{
[{KnowWEPlugin dialog}]
}}}
/%
a simple dialog is embedded in the wiki-page. Answers can be chosen by klicking on them:

[{KnowWEPlugin dialog}]

! External dialog
With the use of the tag 
%%prettify 
{{{
[{KnowWEPlugin dialogLink=}]
}}}
/%
a small icon is rendered, forming a link to the external dialog: [{KnowWEPlugin dialogLink=KnowWE2-ExamplePage..demo}]

__HINT:__ After answering and closing the external dialog the 'solution' button in the upper right corner needs to be pressed to refresh the solution view.


! Text-based custom dialog using Inline-Answering


With the following annotation technique inline-answers can be embedded in common text:

%%prettify 
{{{ 
[word phrase < = > asks:: QuestionText]
}}}
/%

__Example:__

If you  arr hungry you should think about wether you have [something to eat at home <=> Buy some food explains:: Is your fridge empty? = Yes ]. If you have a [date <=> asks:: Do you have a date? ], you definitely should go there, even if youÂ´re [tired <=> asks:: Are you tired from work? ].

With the use of the tag 
%%prettify 
{{{
[{KnowWEPlugin renderKnowledge}]
}}}
/%
a verbalization of the knowledgebase is generated into the page as follows:
