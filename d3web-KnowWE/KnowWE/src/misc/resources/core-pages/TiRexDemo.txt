!!! TiRexDemo

This page shows a small demo of a technique to enter formal knowledge without beeing bound to formal syntax, called TiRex. The solutions are described as bullet lists which are matched to the given domain ontology. Identified findings are compiled and can be used for automated problem solving.

To test this, answer some questions of the following questionniare:

[{KnowWEPlugin Questionsheet}]

In the following the knowledge describing the solutions is defined in a free textual way. The identified terms are highlighted, so one can review what formal knowledge had been generated.


A list of features describing Badminton:
\\
<TiRex solution="Badminton">
* high social interaction
* trains coordination
* low calorie consumption
* on land
* medium running costs
* flexibility: spontanious
* competitive: yes
* high risk of injury
</TiRex>

\\
In the next list Swimming is described:
\\

<TiRex solution="Swimming">
* practicable even with joint problems on the legs
* in water
* medium running costs
* low risk of injury
* spontanious activity
* no competitive action
* low social interaction
* trains endurance
* alleviates stress
* medium calorie consumption
</TiRex>

\\
Running as a third example:
\\

<TiRex solution="Running">
* land sport
* not very competitive
* spontanious training 
* individual kind of sport
* Motivation: endurance, staying fit, losing weight, reducing stress
* quite low Risk of injury
* Trained muscles: lower body
* Medium Calorie Consumption
* cheap equipment costs
* Duration of a training session: 1/2 to 1 hour
</TiRex>
