!__STILL TO DO!__
!1. The wiki principle

!2. Creating new pages

!3. Modifying existing pages

!Conflicts

If someone happens to edit the same page as you at the same time, JSPWiki will prevent you from doing changes and show a conflict page instead. Sorry to say, but the first one to make changes wins...

__A word of warning:__ If you use the Back button of your browser to go into the Edit page, you will almost certainly get a conflict. This is because the browser thinks its still editing an earlier copy of the page.

!Deleting pages

TODO?!

!Adding new pages

Create a link that points to a new (not existing) page using its [WikiName].
Click that new link, which should now have a question mark (?) suffix and
you will get an editor for the new page. -- [Asser]
