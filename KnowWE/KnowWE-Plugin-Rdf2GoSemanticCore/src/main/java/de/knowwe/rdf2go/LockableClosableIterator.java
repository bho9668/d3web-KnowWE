/**
 * Some models have extreme slow downs if during a SPARQL query new statements are added or removed. Concurrent
 * SPARQLs however are no problem. Therefore we use a lock that locks exclusively for writing but shared for
 * reading.<p>
 * This iterator provides the method to lock and unlock the model, so nobody can write while this iterator is used.
 * Be sure to always also unlock (in a try-finally block). If you do not unlock, nobody can write to the model again. Ever.
